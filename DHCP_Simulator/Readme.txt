For this code to be simulated a DHCP server should be configured on a router
This project demonstrates how a device follows the DHCP process to obtain a new IP and how packets are sent and received.

This code allows for both DHCP requests and release however the release can only be done in the same session that a DHCP request was done.

The Topology of the networks is show in the file named Topology.

Router R1 has been configured as the DHCP server to provide IP addresses.
